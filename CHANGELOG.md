# Changelog

All notable changes to this fork are documented here. Versions follow the upstream
nano11 scheme; entries below are local-fork additions on top of upstream 2.1.

## Unreleased (local fork, 2026-10-17)

### Added
- `-ResumeIsoOnly` (aliases `-ResumeIso`, `-IsoResume`): fast-track Phase 14-18 (boot.wim
  patch + ISO mastering) against the preserved `workspace\build\sources\install.wim`
  left by the previous run, rebuilding the bootable ISO in minutes without repeating
  the debloat pipeline. Deep-apply verification is intentionally skipped (metadata +
  payload SHA256 checks run instead).
- `-ForceWinSxSCleanup` (alias `-ForceWinSxS`): opt-in override that runs offline
  `/StartComponentCleanup` (and `/ResetBase`) on Windows 11 24H2+ (26100+), overriding
  the safety block. Experimental; deep-apply verification and ISO payload hash check
  act as safety net.
- `tests/nano11.Tests.ps1`: Pester suite covering AST syntax, unattend schema,
  profile preset integrity, AppX wildcard safety, IME decoupling filter logic,
  language detection, path-safety guards, and end-to-end `-TestSelf` / `-DryRun`.
- `tools/custom-scripts/` skeleton with README and a disabled example script.
- `LICENSE` (MIT) restored to match the README badge.
- Host environment health diagnostics at every build start (RAM capacity, free space,
  physical-disk SMART status) to surface WIM 577 / hash-jitter root causes.
- Build log rotation now compresses logs older than 7 days into `logs/archive.zip`
  and prunes stale `build_diagnostics` runs.

### Changed
- Size-first ISO reduction: language-aware decoupling of foreign Asian IMEs
  (ko-KR / zh-CN / zh-TW / zh-HK removed for ja-JP / en-US targets while the
  Japanese IME + own-language fonts are preserved), ultraSlim trimming of
  self-language Speech/TextToSpeech/OCR FOD packages, `KeepExtraFonts = $false` and
  `RemoveStore = $true` for the extreme / fat32 / handheld presets, `RemoveDrivers =
  $true` (legacy printer/fax/scanner only), and ISO-side cleanup of `sources\sxs`,
  `langpacks`, `sflist*.dat` under ultraSlim.
- App removal hardening at 4 layers: `Microsoft.WindowsBackupApp` (Windows Backup,
  `WindowsBackupClient.exe`) and the Web Experience host (`WebExperienceHostApp.exe`
  = はじめに) - provisioned Appx pattern, residual `SystemApps` folder deletion,
  IFEO execution block, and a FirstLogon per-user Appx fallback.
- Windows Search disable fully enforced: offline WSearch `Start=4` on all control
  sets + `DelayedAutoStart` cleanup + `disable-search.flag` staged for an online
  FirstLogon enforcement (Stop/Set-Service Disabled, SearchHost kill, taskbar search
  box hidden). Status visible in the `Active configuration` summary.
- CrossDeviceResume.exe enforcement: online FirstLogon block that kills the resume
  host and re-asserts the IFEO debugger redirect (the executable ships inside the
  protected `MicrosoftWindows.Client.CBS` shell package on 26H2, so neutralization -
  not deletion - is the correct approach).
- Phase 18 ISO verification retry cooldown extended (2s -> 5s) with forced GC to
  reduce hash-jitter false failures.
- README example path corrected and revision notes added.

### Fixed
- Inverted `keepAsianIME` IME-pattern filter: foreign IME packages are now actually
  removed for ja/en targets (previously the filter dropped them from the removal
  list, leaving all foreign IMEs in the image).
- autounattend.xml raw `&` in the Windows Search enforcement comment that broke
  XML parsing (caught by the self-test, corrected).
- `$resumeIsoAttempt:` interpolated-variable parse error in the new Resume-ISO code
  (caught by `-TestSelf`, corrected).

### Notes
- The 26100+ (24H2+) offline WinSxS cleanup remains **blocked by default**; use
  `-ForceWinSxSCleanup` only after accepting the checkpoint-LCU corruption risk.
- `-ResumeIsoOnly` skips deep-apply verification; run a full build whenever the host
  is stable to re-establish the integrity baseline.
